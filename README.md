# Bike Sharing

## Project Overview

This project creates data visualization for Citi bike share trip data in New York City. The visualization will be presented to investors to influence their decision to invest in a startup bike share program in Des Moines. 
## Results
The following data visualization were used in the Data story prepared for this project. 
- A data visualization based on the August 2019 Trip history data. 
  
 [**Citi Bike Trips Data for August 2019**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/TotalTrips)
 
 There are a total of 2,344,224 bike trips in August 2019.
 

 [**Bike Usage(Bike Trip Duration)**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/CheckoutTimesforUsers)
 
 The 5-6 min bike trips had the most bike count. After 6 mins bike trips, the bike count decreases as the trip duration gets longer.

[**Bike Usage(Bike Trip Duration) by Gender**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/CheckoutTimesbyGender)

The data results have shown that bike sharing is more popular to male bike users than female.

[**Bike Usage by User Type by Gender by Weekday**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/NumberofBikeTripsbyGenderbyeachHouroftheDay)

- For Subscribers: Thursday for all genders
- For Non-Subscribers(Customers): Thursday for Male and Female, Saturday for unknown gender


[**Bike Usage for each day of the Week and Hour of the Day**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/TripsbyWeekdayforEachHour)

- Thursday at 6:00PM has the most bike trips. 
- The daily peak hours for bike trips are at 5:00PM and 6:00PM and 8:00 AM. 
- There are more bike trips during the afternoon work commute than the morning work commute.  

[**Bike Usage by Gender for each day of the Week and Hour of the Day**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/NumberofBikeTripsbyGenderbyeachHouroftheDay)

- For both females and males, the most bike trips happen on Thursday at 6:00 PM. 
- For the unknown gender, the most bike trips happen on Saturday at 12:00 PM. The peak hours for bikes trips are from 11:00 AM to 6 PM. 


## Summary
[**NYC Citi Bike Story**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.gribbon#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStoryNYC/BikeSharingProposal?publish=yes)
   
   The data results have shown:
   - Bike sharing is more popular to male bike users than female. 
   - Bike users prefer to pay for subscriptions. 
   - The bike usage is at its peak during afternoon work commute. 
   - The most of the bike trip durations are less than half an hour. 
   
On the given dataset, I would suggest adding the visualization on the gender and birth year This will provide a user profile that will help target people based on gender to join the bike share program. Another visualization that could be added is the number of trips for each start station name by weekday by hour of the day. This will provide information on the bike usage on each station each day and every hour of the day.
